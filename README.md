# Agentic Data Mesh Demo: Initial Specification

## High-Level Goal

This document outlines the initial specification for a demo showcasing autonomous agents that can transform a raw, stream-based data environment into a product-oriented, discoverable data mesh. The primary goal of this initial phase is to align on the plan and gather feedback before implementation begins.

## Phase 1: Foundational Setup & Specification (This PR)

### Objective

The objective of this first pull request is to submit this high-level plan and specification for community/stakeholder feedback.

### The Contextual Environment

The foundation of the demo is a "contextual environment" representing a typical state of raw, siloed data streams within an organization.

*   **Platform:** Confluent Cloud
*   **Data Source:** Standard Confluent sample data topics.
*   **Initial Topics:**
    *   `users`
    *   `orders`
    *   `products`

These topics will serve as the initial, unstructured data sources that the agents will work with.

### The Agentic Workflow (High-Level)

The core of the demo is to observe agents performing the following workflow autonomously:

1.  **Discovery & Ingestion:** Agents will be configured to connect to the specified Confluent topics and begin ingesting the data streams.

2.  **Analysis & Enrichment:** Agents will analyze the raw data to understand its structure, content, and relationships. To enrich this analysis, they will leverage external tools and metadata sources, such as:
    *   **Schema Registry:** To understand the formal structure of the data.
    *   **Usage Metrics:** To identify which data is frequently used or critical.

3.  **Data Product Definition:** Based on their analysis, the agents will autonomously define and register new data products. This process involves:
    *   Identifying bounded contexts and potential data product boundaries (e.g., a "User Profile" data product from the `users` topic).
    *   Generating the necessary configurations (e.g., Terraform files, data catalog entries) to formally define the data product, its schema, ownership, and access policies.

## Future Phases (High-Level)

*   Implementation of the agents themselves.
*   Development of the Terraform configurations that the agents will generate and manage.
*   Creation of the final presentation and a self-guided version of the demo.
