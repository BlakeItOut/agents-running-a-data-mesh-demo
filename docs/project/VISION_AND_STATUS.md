# Agents Running a Data Mesh Demo - Vision & Status

## 🎯 THE END VISION

**The Story:** Autonomous agents transform a chaotic data swamp into an organized, governed data mesh - with strategic human oversight.

**The Demo Journey:**
1. **START:** 37 unorganized data streams across 12 domains (raw chaos)
2. **DISCOVER:** Agents autonomously analyze infrastructure, usage, and metrics
3. **PROPOSE:** Agents suggest data products based on patterns and domain knowledge
4. **EVALUATE:** Specialist agents assess scope, timeline, and cost
5. **DECIDE:** Humans approve/reject proposals at strategic checkpoints
6. **IMPLEMENT:** Agents generate code, configurations, and documentation
7. **END RESULT:** Well-organized, discoverable data mesh with governance

- **Cost:** ~$9-10/hour or ~$220-240/day (can be destroyed when not in use)
- **Deployment Time:** 15-20 minutes

### Working Agents (Monitoring Layer)

#### 1. Deployment Agent ✅
**File:** `agents/monitoring/deployment.py`

**What it does:**
- Discovers all infrastructure via MCP (Model Context Protocol + Confluent Cloud API)
- Identifies 37 topics, schemas, connectors
- Groups topics into 12 domains by namespace analysis
- Publishes comprehensive state to `agent-state-deployment` topic

**Key Features:**
- Real MCP integration with Confluent Cloud
- Supports dry-run mode with synthetic data
- Autonomous infrastructure discovery

#### 2. Usage Agent ✅
**File:** `agents/monitoring/usage.py`

**What it does:**
- Tracks consumption patterns and usage (synthetic data currently)
- Identifies idle vs high-traffic topics
- Tracks consumer groups and consumption rates
- Publishes usage state to `agent-state-usage` topic

**Current State:** Synthetic data simulating realistic production usage:
- 7 consumer groups actively consuming
- 24 active consumers
- Top 10 topics by consumption (clickstream: 1247 msg/sec, transactions: 856 msg/sec)
- 3 idle topics identified

**Future:** Will query actual Confluent Cloud Metrics API

#### 3. Metrics Agent ✅
**File:** `agents/monitoring/metrics.py`

**What it does:**
- Monitors system health and performance (synthetic data currently)
- Tracks throughput, latency, error rates
- Detects consumer lag and bottlenecks
- Publishes metrics state to `agent-state-metrics` topic

**Current State:** Synthetic data simulating production metrics:
- 15.3 MB/s throughput
- 32ms average latency
- 0.2% error rate
- 6 topics with consumer lag
- 847.5 GB storage used

**Future:** Will query Confluent Cloud Metrics API

#### 4. Current State Agent ✅
**File:** `agents/ideation/current_state.py`

**What it does:**
- Consumes from all three monitoring topics
- Uses Claude AI to synthesize states into human-readable insights
- Generates summary and notable observations
- Publishes aggregated state to `agent-state-current` topic
- **This becomes the input for the Learning Agent**

**Key Features:**
- Full Claude API integration for intelligent synthesis
- Fallback mechanism if Claude unavailable
- Aggregates deployment, usage, and metrics into coherent view

#### 5. Bootstrap Orchestrator ✅
**File:** `agents/bootstrap.py`

**What it does:**
- Orchestrates all 4 monitoring agents in sequence
- Runs end-to-end monitoring layer pipeline
- Supports dry-run mode for testing without Kafka
- Provides clear progress reporting and summaries

**Run time:** ~10-30 seconds (depending on MCP connection)

**Usage:**
```bash
cd agents
python bootstrap.py              # Full run with Kafka
python bootstrap.py --dry-run    # Test mode without Kafka
```

### Common Utilities ✅

**Files:** `agents/common/`
- `kafka_utils.py` - Kafka producers/consumers with Avro serialization
- `claude_utils.py` - Claude API wrapper for synthesis
- `schema_utils.py` - Schema loading and validation

**Schemas:** All 4 Avro schemas defined in `agents/schemas/`

## 📝 PRESENTATION NOTES

### Opening Hook:
*"What if your data infrastructure could organize itself? Not with rigid rules, but with intelligent agents that understand usage patterns, domain boundaries, and business value?"*

### Demo Setup:
- Pre-deploy Terraform (15 min before demo)
- Have Confluent Cloud UI open in browser
- Terminal ready in `agents/` directory
- Dry-run tested beforehand

### Backup Plan:
- Dry-run mode works without Kafka
- Pre-recorded video of bootstrap.py output
- Screenshots of Confluent Cloud UI

### Q&A Prep:
- **Q:** "Why agents instead of traditional automation?"
  - **A:** "Agents can reason about trade-offs, not just execute rules"
- **Q:** "What about AI hallucinations?"
  - **A:** "That's why we have human checkpoints at every strategic decision"
- **Q:** "Can this work with other data platforms?"
  - **A:** "Yes! The agent pattern is platform-agnostic. We use MCP for Confluent, but same approach works with Snowflake, Databricks, etc."
