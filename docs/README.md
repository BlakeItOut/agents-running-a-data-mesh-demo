## Common Tasks

### Setting Up for the First Time
1. Read [Vision and Status](project/VISION_AND_STATUS.md) to understand the project
2. Follow [Terraform Setup Guide](setup/TERRAFORM_GUIDE.md) to deploy infrastructure
3. Configure credentials with [Environment Configuration](setup/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md)
4. Start agents with [Agent Getting Started](agents/GETTING_STARTED.md)

### Running the Agent Pipeline
1. Ensure infrastructure is deployed (Terraform)
2. Configure `agents/.env` with Kafka and Claude credentials
3. Run: `cd agents && ./venv/bin/python3 bootstrap.py`
4. Follow prompts in [Human Refinement Workflow](workflows/HUMAN_REFINEMENT.md)

### Understanding the Architecture
1. Start with [Architecture](agents/ARCHITECTURE.md) for visual flow diagrams
2. Read [Agent Getting Started](agents/GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed explanations
3. Review [Evaluation Phase](workflows/EVALUATION_PHASE.md) for Phase 3 details

### Preparing a Demo
1. Review [Vision and Status](project/VISION_AND_STATUS.md) for demo script
2. Understand [Architecture](agents/ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical explanations
3. Practice [Human Refinement Workflow](workflows/HUMAN_REFINEMENT.md) interactions

### Troubleshooting
- **Terraform issues**: See [Terraform Setup Guide](setup/TERRAFORM_GUIDE.md) troubleshooting section
- **Authentication issues**: See [Environment Configuration](setup/ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md)
- **Agent issues**: See [Agent Getting Started](agents/GETTING_STARTED.md) troubleshooting section

## Cost Management

This system uses paid services. See these guides for cost management:
- [Terraform Setup Guide](setup/TERRAFORM_GUIDE.md) - Confluent Cloud costs (~$9-10/hour)
- [Agent Getting Started](agents/GETTING_STARTED.md) - Claude API costs

**Key Tip**: Use `terraform destroy` when not actively using the system to minimize costs.
