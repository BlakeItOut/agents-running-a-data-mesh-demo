## Part 1: Introduction & Context (10 minutes)

### Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title**: From Chaos to Clarity: Building a Data Mesh with an AI Agent Team

## Part 2: The "Chaos" - The Problem (10 minutes)

### Slide 4: The Reality of Data Platforms
- The dream: Self-service data access
- The reality: Cognitive overload
- Every team needs expertise in Kafka, Kubernetes, Terraform, schemas, governance...
- "Self-serve" platforms are often just piles of complex tools

**Speaker Notes**: Show of hands - who here has tried to implement a self-service data platform? How's that going? The cognitive load is crushing. We expect every developer to be an expert in distributed systems, infrastructure as code, schema design, and governance.

### Slide 5: Data Mesh Promise vs Reality
**Promise**:
- Domain Ownership
- Data as a Product
- Self-Serve Platform
- Federated Governance

**Reality**:
- Requires immense discipline
- Huge platform team needed
- Extensive developer training
- High initial friction kills adoption

**Speaker Notes**: The Data Mesh principles are sound. But the implementation burden is enormous. Most organizations don't have the resources or patience.

### Slide 6: The Data Product Lifecycle is Broken
**Section Header Slide**

### Slide 7: Friction at Every Stage
- üìê Design: Endless meetings, inconsistent schemas
- üèóÔ∏è Scaffold: Copy-paste errors, forgotten governance
- üíª Implement: Repetitive boilerplate, testing overhead
- üìö Document: Always an afterthought, quickly stale
- üîç Operate: What to monitor? How to build dashboards?

**Speaker Notes**: Let's walk through what it actually takes to create a data product today. At every stage, there's friction, manual work, and opportunities for mistakes.

### Slide 8: The Core Problem - The "First Mile"
- Getting started is the hardest part
- Initial friction is too high
- Leads to shortcuts, inconsistencies, technical debt
- Ultimately, failed data mesh initiatives

**Speaker Notes**: The "first mile" problem is what kills data mesh projects. If it's hard to get started correctly, people won't do it correctly.

## Part 3: The "Clarity" - Solution (5 minutes)

### Slide 9: A New Mental Model
"What if every developer had a senior data architect as a pair-programmer?"

The AI Agent Team:
- Knows best practices and platform standards
- Handles boilerplate and configuration
- Enforces governance by default
- Lets developers focus on business logic

**Speaker Notes**: Imagine having a senior architect who knows every pattern, every standard, every governance requirement - and who never gets tired of writing boilerplate. That's what we're building.

### Slide 10: Meet the Agent Team
- üèóÔ∏è The Architect: Design and schema expert
- ‚öôÔ∏è The Engineer: Infrastructure and bootstrapping specialist
- üíª The Coder: Pair-programmer for business logic and testing
- üìö The Scribe: Documentation and cataloging assistant
- üîç The SRE: Site Reliability Expert for observability

**Speaker Notes**: Instead of one generalist AI, we have specialists. Each agent is an expert in its domain.

### Slide 11: The "Contribution First" Workflow
- Agents don't deploy directly to production
- They generate Pull Requests
- Humans review, validate, approve
- Governance is built-in, not bolted on
- Knowledge transfer through readable code

**Speaker Notes**: This is crucial - we're not advocating for autonomous deployment. Agents create perfect starting points. Humans remain in control.

## Part 4: LIVE DEMO (25 minutes)

### Slide 12: LIVE DEMO (Section Header)

### Slide 13: Building "user-authentication-events" Data Product
We'll follow the complete lifecycle:
1. Chapter 1: The Blueprint (The Architect)
2. Chapter 2: The Foundation (The Engineer)
3. Chapter 3: The Logic (The Coder)
4. Chapter 4: The Manual (The Scribe)
5. Chapter 5: The Watchtower (The SRE)

**Speaker Notes**: Over the next 25 minutes, I'm going to show you how these agents work together to build a production-ready data product from a single prompt.

### Slides 14-18: Demo Chapter Slides
*(One slide per agent/chapter explaining their role and expected output)*

### Slide 19: Let's Watch It In Action
**[SWITCH TO TERMINAL/IDE]**

Starting prompt:
> "I need a new data product for user-authentication-events. The schema needs userId, eventTimestamp, ipAddress, userAgent, and loginSuccess (boolean). Tag ipAddress and userAgent as PII. SLOs: 99.9% completeness, 5-second delivery latency."

**Demo Flow**:

1. **The Architect (5 min)**:
   - Chat interface shows the agent thinking
   - Agent asks clarifying questions
   - Generates data contract with schema and SLOs
   - Shows the contract file

2. **The Engineer (5 min)**:
   - Agent takes the contract
   - Generates Avro schema
   - Creates Terraform configs
   - Scaffolds Kafka Streams app
   - Opens Pull Request
   - Walk through the PR - show clean code structure

3. **The Coder (5 min)**:
   - Prompt: "Filter for successful logins only"
   - Agent writes filter logic
   - Generates unit tests
   - Shows test passing

4. **The Scribe (5 min)**:
   - Agent scans project
   - Generates comprehensive README
   - Registers in data catalog
   - Show the catalog entry

5. **The SRE (5 min)**:
   - Agent defines metrics
   - Generates Datadog dashboard Terraform
   - Shows dashboard config
   - Explains the monitoring strategy

**Speaker Notes**: [Throughout demo, narrate what's happening, highlight the quality of the generated code, emphasize that it's production-ready not just a prototype]

## Part 5: Conclusion (5 minutes)

### Slide 20: The Agentic Lifecycle Revisited
üèóÔ∏è Design ‚Üí ‚öôÔ∏è Scaffold ‚Üí üíª Implement ‚Üí üìö Document ‚Üí üîç Operate

- Each agent is a specialist
- Together, they form a complete team
- Humans remain in control

**Speaker Notes**: What we just saw was the complete lifecycle, automated but governed. Every step created reviewable, understandable artifacts.

### Slide 21: Key Takeaways
- **Specialization over Generalization**: Focused agents beat generalists
- **Humans in the Loop**: Augmentation, not replacement
- **From Months to Minutes**: Transform development economics
- **Built-in Governance**: Standards enforced by default
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Every PR teaches best practices

**Speaker Notes**: The key insight is that we're not trying to replace developers. We're giving them superpowers.

### Slide 22: What's Next?
- Proactive agents that suggest schema migrations
- Automated data quality issue detection and remediation
- Autonomous performance optimization
- Cross-domain data product discovery
- Self-healing systems

**Speaker Notes**: This is just the beginning. Imagine agents that proactively prevent problems, not just create new things.

### Slide 23: The Bigger Picture
This isn't just about data products.

It's about rethinking how we build platforms:
- Reduce cognitive load on developers
- Encode institutional knowledge in agents
- Make the "right way" the easy way
- Enable speed without breaking things

**Speaker Notes**: The patterns we've shown today apply to any complex platform problem. The future of platform engineering is agentic.

## Q&A Preparation (5 minutes)

**Anticipated Questions**:

1. **Q**: How do you handle hallucinations or incorrect code?
   **A**: Multi-layered approach - PR reviews, automated testing, schema validation. The "contribution first" model means humans catch issues before production.

2. **Q**: What LLM are you using?
   **A**: Currently experimenting with Claude/GPT-4, but the architecture is model-agnostic.

3. **Q**: How much does this cost to run?
   **A**: Token costs are real but compare favorably to engineer time. A full lifecycle run costs $2-5 in API calls vs. 40-60 hours of engineer time.

4. **Q**: Can agents learn from our specific codebase?
   **A**: Yes - we use RAG over your codebase and docs. Agents learn your patterns and standards.

5. **Q**: What about security and access control?
   **A**: Agents run with limited permissions, can't merge PRs, all actions are auditable. Secrets management is handled separately.

6. **Q**: How long did this take to build?
   **A**: The demo took weeks to build, but represents patterns that can be generalized to any platform domain.
